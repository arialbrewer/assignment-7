## Package: ggplot2

### Location
##### This package is part of the Tidyverse which can be installed via CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html or GitHub https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

### Vignettes
##### The ggplot2 package has three formal vignettes listed on the CRAN website that address different topics within the package:
###### This vignette shows how to extend ggplot2 by creating a new stat, geom, or theme: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/extending-ggplot2.html
###### This vignette is intended for package developers who use ggplot2 within their package code: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2-in-packages.html
###### This vignette summarises the various formats that grid drawing functions take: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html

### Applications
##### There are a vast number of applications of ggplot2 in various puplications, twitter posts, websites and tutorials. It is likely one of the most popular packages in the Tidyverse.

### Review
##### ggplot2 is a widely used and popular package, and available on both CRAN and GitHub. The primary purpose of this package is a plotting package that is more streamlined than the base R plot function. When compared to the plot function, ggplot2 has a wide variety of options and many R users have also made various aesthetic arguments that can be used such as custom color palettes. I'm still learning the ins and outs of ggplot2, along with many tidyverse packages but I have yet to find something I don't like. Since the R community that uses this package is so large, there are many resources for help, including the RStudio community (https://community.rstudio.com/) and Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&pageSize=50)
